		<header>general guidelines</header>
		<p>Writing clean and readable code is not hard, but it is very 
			important towards the maintainability of your program.
			<br>
			Readability is achieved by through experience and practiced 
			intuition, but can be guided by key principles including:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Good variable names</strong>. Every variable should
			    have an identifier (name) that directly reflects what it 
			    represents. A variable that is describing the number of
			    ducks in a pond might be called ducks or count but it shouldn't 
			    be called something like pancakes. Never name your variables 
			    as single letters (except for counters in for loops) or anything too abstract.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Function naming and responsibility</strong>. Make 
				sure your functions also are named well represent what the 
				function does. Every function should also have a single 
				responsibility, something you could describe in a sentence 
				or two. (This is called the SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE).
			</li>
			<li><strong>Proper formatting</strong>. Always maintain correct
			    and consistent indentation, spacing, and location of curly 
			    braces, if required by the language. One of the most helpful motivations 
			    for clean and consistent formatting is to consider the
			    perspective of the person trying to understand your code, making
			    sure one could painlessly read and interpret your
			    code's purpose through a consistent organization and hierarchal
			    structure.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Clear documentation</strong>. You should provide 
				clear documentation in all of your web development work, 
				describing functions, key variables or constants, and any
				particularly complex sections of 
			    code. At the same time, your documentation should be
			    client-focused, avoiding implementation details about how your 
			    programs are implemented (this latter point is especially
			    relevant when working with function-based programming languages 
		        like JavaScript and PHP).
		    </li>
		</ol>

		<header class="sub-header">commenting for your css and html code</header>
		<p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in your HTML source code.
		   Text written inside of comment tags are not displayed by the browser.
		   The comment tag is <code>&lt;!-- your comment here --&gt;</code>.
		   <br>
		   <br>
		   The comments in CSS are wrapped between <code> /* your comment here
		   */</code>. Comments in HTML and CSS can also span multiple lines.

	    <header class="sub-header">commenting your javascript code</header>
	    <p>
	    	There are two different ways to comment in JavaScript code:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
   			<li><strong>Single-line comments:</strong> Including  <code>//</code>
	   		  in front of the single line of code that you want to comment out.
	   		</li>
	   		<li><strong>Multi-line comments:</strong> This method of commenting 
	   			is exactly the same as commenting CSS files. You insert multiple lines of
	   			<br>
	   			code between the following: <code>/* your comment here */</code>
	   		</li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>JavaScript is used <strong>boundlessly</strong> to develop huge 
		   applications and Application Program Interfaces (APIs). Because of
		   this, good documentation of the application is necessary. To 
		   document our API's and applications, we use a documentation generator called
	   	   <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a>.
	   	   <br>
	   	   Some of the important <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> rules:
	   	</p>
	    <ol>
		    <li>Each comment must start with a <code>/**</code> sequence in order to be
			    recognized by the <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> parser.
			    Comments beginning with <code>/*</code>, <code>/***</code>, or more than 
				3 stars will be ignored. This is to suppress parsing of comment blocks.
			</li>
		    <li>Use <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> tags to provide more 
		        information about the code:
			    <ul>
				    <li>If the function to be commented is a constructor, then add a 
			   	    	<code>@constructor</code> tag to it.
			   	    </li>
			        <li>Use <code>@param {data type}</code> to tag the parameters. Each 
			            parameter gets a different tag and on a different line.
			        </li>
				    <li>Use <code>@return {data type}</code> to tag the return type for the
				        function. Explain what it represents in a sentence.
				    </li>
			    </ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>The comment should also include a single sentence description for 
		   	    the function as well as for each parameter.
		   	</li>
	    </ol>

	    <p>Though you are not required to for this class, you can generate the 
	       documentation webpage, run the following command in a terminal
	       window: <code>jsdoc relative-path/book.js</code>
	       <br>
	       This command will create a directory named <code>out/</code> in the 
	       current working directory. Within that directory, you will find the generated HTML pages.
	    </p>
	    <header class="sub-header">commenting your php code</header>
	    <p>Commenting in PHP is exactly the same as commenting in JavaScript 
	       by using <code>//</code> for single-line comments and <code>/* ... 
	   	   */</code> for multi-line comments.
	   	   <br>
	   	   <br>
	       <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Make sure to add the comment 
	       after the opening PHP tag as shown below.
	    </p>

	    <header class="sub-header">commenting your sql</header>
	    <p>
	       We're going to cut you some slack here... we don't require you to
	       comment your SQL code (It is pretty much self-explanatory, isn't it?).
	       <br>
	       <br>
	       Now that you have read this document, make this quote your mantra:
	    </p>
	    <div>"Writing well-documented code is not only important for communicating 
    	        with others in your team.
    	        <br>
    	        It's also for communicating with yourself in the future."
    	        <br>
